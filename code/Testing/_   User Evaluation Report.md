Hallway Testing 
================

Hallway testing is a form of usability testing which is a very quick and cheap method that involves random selected people e.g. those passing by in a hallway, are asked to test out the application. In this case, we picked classmates to check out to use our application and recorded their response by asking them to do a quick questionnaire in the end. 

For the hallway testing, the group approached people with the final prototype and gave them some time to look around the application. The group then showed them the log in process in the doctor’s perspective at first, and showed them the admin page. A user was then created, based roughly on the person’s details (name, date of birth) and gave them a username and password. The group then brought up the homepage where the person could log in to their own profile. They logged in to their own profiles and then started to navigate through the different tabs, viewing the different details that were added about them beforehand. 

Feedback 
---------

The group created a quick questionnaire to get feedback from the users about their user experience. It asked users to rank, between 1-10 some aspects of the application, like “How easy was it to use?”. 

The feedback was mostly positive. The average score for “Usability” was 8-9/10, the design with a 7/10 score and functionality with 7/10. The group also asked if they would use the application if it was available and the majority answered with “Yes”. 

Some of the bugs were present during the demonstration and some users found them. One user entered their username and password wrong and noted that “there was no indication” that they had it incorrect. The page simply refreshed, with the log in fields for the username and password resetting to blank fields. The same thing happened to the log out button, as it doesn’t show an indication if the person was actually logged out. 

A couple users tried click the “forgot password” button on the log in page and discovered that it didn’t do anything. The group told them that this feature wasn’t incorporated yet. Also, some users clicked the green plus button at the bottom of the doctor page to no avail, another feature that the group hasn’t implemented. 

Conclusion 
-----------

The objectives that the group set out in the beginning of the project, providing an appealing, easy to use UI and a functional application, was met. Overall, from the questionnaire results, the user satisfaction was pretty good. Apart from the small bugs and features that haven’t been implemented fully, the people that took part in the user evaluation gave us mostly positive feedback. They found it painless to use, said that the contrasting colours in the design were eye catching and some were even impressed with the logo that the group made.
